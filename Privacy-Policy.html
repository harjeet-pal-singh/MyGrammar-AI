    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>MyGrammar AI ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("you" or "your"). This Privacy Policy explains in detail how we collect, use, store, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, MyGrammar AI (the "App"). We respect your privacy and are transparent about our practices. By accessing or using the App, you agree to the terms described in this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE APP.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>When you use MyGrammar AI, we collect only the minimum personal information necessary to provide our services. This includes your email address, which is used solely for OTP-based authentication and account access. We do not ask for your name, phone number, address, or any demographic details.</p>

    <h3>Grammar Input and Saved Data</h3>
    <p>When you enter text into the App for grammar checking, the text is processed to provide corrections. These inputs are not permanently stored by default. Grammar corrections are saved to your history only when you explicitly press the "Save" button. Unsaved text and corrections are not retained.</p>

    <h3>Usage Information</h3>
    <p>We may collect limited usage-related information such as feature usage frequency (for example, number of grammar checks used per day or hour) to enforce free-tier limits (5 checks per day and up to 2 checks per hour) and to ensure proper functioning of the App. This data is used only for operational purposes.</p>

    <h3>Device Information</h3>
    <p>We may automatically collect basic device-related information such as device type, operating system version, and app version. This information helps us maintain compatibility, improve performance, and fix bugs. We do not use this information to identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To authenticate users securely using OTP-based email login</li>
      <li>To provide grammar checking features and display saved correction history when enabled by the user</li>
      <li>To enforce daily and hourly usage limits in the free tier</li>
      <li>To maintain, improve, and optimize app performance and stability</li>
      <li>To communicate important service-related updates, such as security or feature changes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your data for advertising, marketing profiling, or behavioral tracking.</p>

    <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.</p>
    <p>We may share limited information only in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With trusted service providers (such as backend hosting or email OTP services) strictly for app functionality</li>
      <li>When required by law, regulation, or valid legal process</li>
      <li>To protect the rights, safety, or security of users, the App, or the public</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, or transfer of assets, user information may be transferred as part of the business assets, subject to the same privacy protections.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, misuse, alteration, or disclosure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, no digital system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Saved grammar corrections remain available in your history until you manually remove them or until account management features (such as delete account) are introduced in future updates. Currently, account deletion and data removal features are not available.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices and Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may choose whether or not to save grammar corrections</li>
      <li>You may stop using the App at any time</li>
      <li>You may contact us to request clarification about stored data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As of now, in-app options to delete accounts or update email information are not available but may be added in future versions.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>MyGrammar AI is intended for general users and students. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that such information has been collected, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may rely on third-party services for essential functionality such as backend hosting, authentication, or grammar processing. These services are used only to operate the App and are required to follow appropriate data protection standards.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in features, legal requirements, or operational practices. Any updates will be posted within the App or associated platform pages. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your data, you may contact us at:</p>
    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:support@mygrammarai.com">support@mygrammarai.com</a></p>

    <p>By using MyGrammar AI, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to this Privacy Policy.</p>
