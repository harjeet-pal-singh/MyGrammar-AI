  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the MyGrammar AI mobile application (the "App") operated by MyGrammar AI ("we," "us," or "our"). By using the App, you agree to these Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE APP.</p>

  <h2>1.1 Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms occasionally to reflect changes in features, services, or legal requirements. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

  <h2>2. Services Provided</h2>
  <p>The App allows users to check grammar and save correction history. The grammar correction functionality is powered by third-party AI services. We provide the platform, user interface, and optional history management, while the AI engine processes the text inputs.</p>

  <h2>2.1 Usage Limits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Free users:</strong> Maximum text per check: 1,000 characters</li>
    <li>Daily limit: 5 grammar checks</li>
    <li>Hourly limit: 2 grammar checks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Premium users (if applicable) limits may vary and will be defined in the subscription details. We reserve the right to adjust usage limits at any time to ensure fair and stable service.</p>

  <h2>2.2 Prohibited Uses</h2>
  <p>You may not use the App for illegal activities, harassment, spamming, or any action that violates applicable laws or regulations. You also may not attempt to reverse-engineer, copy, or misuse the App or its underlying services.</p>

  <h2>3. Privacy</h2>
  <p>Please review our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> to understand how we collect, use, and protect your information when using the App.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App relies on third-party AI services to provide grammar correction functionality. By using the App, you acknowledge that your text inputs may be processed by these third-party services. We do not control their internal policies, but we ensure that data is transmitted securely and used only for processing corrections.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All design, interface, and content you see in the App (except AI-generated outputs) are owned by MyGrammar AI. AI-generated grammar suggestions belong to the AI service provider but may be displayed and stored in your App history.</p>

  <h2>6. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at our discretion for any violation of these Terms. Upon termination, any saved data remains accessible only in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which MyGrammar AI is based. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of local courts for any disputes.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
